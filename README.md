Pampered Pets Database System

Client:
Jude and Greer McMann own a small animal boarding kennel called Pampered Pets Resort in Little Creek, Delaware.
They have been in business for 5 years and their current information is not computerized, which they found to be inefficient.

What they wanted from us:
To get the record keeping up to date and to offer more services to their customers.
